Comp.exe

This exe will compile all the files necesary for a map to be loaded.

Syntax:
comp.exe tex1.tga tex2.tga tex3.tga map.s4w

this will compile all of those files into one called out.cmp

NOTICE!!!!
The name of the .s4w map should be the same name of the cmp file. So in this case the out.cmp
must be renamed to map.cmp.
